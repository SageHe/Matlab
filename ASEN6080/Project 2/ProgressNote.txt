Left off having processed the part 3 measurements with a CKF with PN, not looking too bad now that
I remembered to switch the sign on the madrid station longitude (heh). Should try to get either the 
EKF initialized with the CKF working or perhaps the SRIF/UKF. Anthony might be able to help with 
SRIF. Should probably first get B-plane event function and estimate working so in worst-case 
scenario it can be used for parts 2 and 3, and calculation of B-plane at different SOIs can be used
for 4.
