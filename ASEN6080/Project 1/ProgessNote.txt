Looks like changing P0 pos. and vel from [1 1 1 1 1 1] to [1e-6 1e-6 1e-6 1e-10 1e-10 1e-10]
has little effect, Batch basically no effect, might just be able to use these results
and run with idea that both filters are relatively robust to changes in cov and data noise
cov, with the batch being more robust than the CKF?
