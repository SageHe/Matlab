This main script for the ASEN 6080 project will run all filters necessary to produce all plots given in the
associated report. Due to the large number of plots produced, I would recommend running each section one at
time to observe the plots for each slight change to the filter or for each filter on its own. Each section 
should produce 12-13 plots including state etimates and erros, covariance ellipses, residuals, and covariance 
traces vs time. The covariance RMS values are calculated but are provided in the report as well.

The last two sections of the Batch Filter and CKF used to look at the effect of fixed vs unfixed station positions
were repeatedly changed and re-run to produce the table seen in section 6 of the report
