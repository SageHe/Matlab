[num, txt, raw] = xlsread('Section9_data');%Reads the the text, numerical, and raw data from the Excel file into matlab

for i = 3:103%Makes a counter from 3 to 103

    score = (score * 5);%Multiplies score by 5
    score = (score + raw{i,5});%Adds the value of the value in the ith row of the 5th column of every row, or the short answer score
    total = [total score];%Concatenates the value of total and the value of score in to a vector
    clear lump_sum%Clears the lump_sum variable for the next iteration of the ith counter loop
end
histogram(total,10)%Makes a histogram of the calculated scores with a scale of ten on the x axis and the number of students who recieved that score on the y axis
